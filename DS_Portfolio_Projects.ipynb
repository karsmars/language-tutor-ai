I would also like a model that is small enough to run on my own computer (or in Google Colab) and free or very cheap. Bonus points if the model can process and output very quickly so I can simulate real-time conversation. I can scale things up as needed. I'll investigate models such as OpenAI's GPT 4, Google's Gemini and others.\n",
